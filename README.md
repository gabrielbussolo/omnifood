# Omnifood

Omnifood is a fictional project developed during the "[Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)" course. 

## Why I took this course?
I took this course to recycle my front end skills and learn something new. Is a dated course but it has a good rank in udemy, so to my goal (remember the basics of front end) served very well.

### Some skills developed during the course:
- HTML5
  - Semantic
  - Best pratices
- CSS3
  - Animations
  - Transitions
  - Pseudo-classes
  - Pseudo-elements
- JS
  - Basic of jQuery
- Design
  - Real basics about design
